You can write Spring MVC controllers that are computed into Micronaut controllers at compilation time. The programming model is largely compatible with Spring Web Reactive.

Only `@RestController` semantics are supported, which is fine for most Microservice use cases. Special support is provided by the `micronaut-spring-web` dependency to allowing returning a link:{springapi}/org/springframework/http/ResponseEntity.html[ResponseEntity].

The binding semantics as described in the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#binding[Micronaut documentation] and are generally equivalent to how Spring MVC behaves.

The following additional, Spring specific, method argument types are supported:

.Supported Method Argument Types

|Type | Notes

|link:{springapi}/org/springframework/http/server/reactive/ServerHttpRequest.html.html[ServerHttpRequest]
|For receiving the whole reactive request
